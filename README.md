Dollar-And-Cents Case: Hidden factors behind the story")

## Summary: 

* According to an article by Forbes even undergraduate women from Harvard believe that when they are going to earn they will get 78 cents on a dollar compared to men just because they are women. Those women admitted to Harvard can be distinguished from the smartest, most talented and most dedicated of their high school peers but even if they can freak out over the issue, we feel anyone can feel the same. 

* Being a woman dominated group (“in the number of participants”) we are very much concerned that all of our hard work should not become a victim of gender bias if it exists. Here, we found our way to start our analysis of this critical issue of PAY wage gap in the USA. 

## Claim:

*Researchers claim that women in the USA earn 78 cents on the dollar compare to men, this story doesn’t hold good for gender bias. The project does not hold any specific claim for the issue whereas we tried analyzing several factors contributing to the difference. 
* In order to resolve the issue women should come up with a clear understanding of what they doing wrong or what holds them back.Women voluntarily picked up lesser paying jobs and there are fields in which women are earning equally to men in the same profession such as Tennis. 
* There are fields such as entertainment and movies in which women are earning less but it requires critical analysis of genre, screen time, lead role e.t.c. 
* However, we cannot just conclude with one metrics that women are not the victim of discrimination but pay wage gap is certainly a huge issue and we suggest that women right from the early education should boost their Morale to pick up high-paid occupations.

## Audience:

* This visualization is a story-telling to any non-technical audience. The target audience is general public and whosoever is concerned with this information.
* However, we will encourage females to get insights from the project as it reveals many strong factors about picking up the right jobs in order to overcome unequal gender pay.
